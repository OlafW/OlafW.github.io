      Solastalgia, a film by
      <a class="visible_link" href="https://elinekersten.com/"
        >Eline Kersten,</a
      >
      is about the ENCI limestone quarry in Maastricht, The Netherlands. The
      film explores the relation of the ENCI quarry and factory with its
      environment, the history and the impact on its surroundings and local
      community. For this work I made the music and sound design. Together with
      Eline I made on-site field-recordings at the ENCI quarry, the factory and
      the caves. Watch the trailer below.
