      Tussenwater is a video installation made in collaboration with Merel
      Dames. The film shows close-ups of water reflections of various locations
      around Utrecht, The Netherlands. The water distorts the reflected
      environment, creating abstract, moving images. The sound is made from
      field-recordings from the same locations. They are processed, giving water
      sounds musical qualities and musical sound water-like qualities.

      Tussenwater was shown in fortress Honswijk, May 2018. We made use of the
      architecture of the fortress to project image and sound, such as the
      arched seiling and a 30-meter long tunnel as shown below.
