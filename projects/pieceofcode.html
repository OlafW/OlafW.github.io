      Together with
      <a class="visible_link" href="https://pieceofcode.club/">Piece of Code</a>
      I teach creative-coding and robotics in primary and secondary schools in
      The Netherlands. Piece of code is an organization where young people learn
      to creativily express themselves and learn new skills such as
      computational thinking and electronics. In the programming lessons the
      students learn how code by making their own animations in p5js. In the
      robotics courses students learn to work with various educational robots,
      such as BBC micro:bit and Ozobot. They create their own creative projects,
      such as an obstacle-avoiding robot, or a drawing robot.
