      For my graduation project for the Media Technology MSc programme I
      researched relationships between digital sound synthesis and physical
      interfaces through the development of 3 novel musical interfaces.

      In acoustic musical instruments, there is an inherent connection between
      sound production and control: the instrument is both the sound source and
      a means to control the qualities of the sound. In digital musical
      instruments, there is a clear separation between sound production: the
      sound synthesis, and control: the physical interface, such as a
      MIDI-keyboard or MIDI-controller. We have to explicitly design
      relationships between the sound synthesis and the controller. For my
      graduation research I ask the following question
