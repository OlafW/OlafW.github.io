      For my graduation project for the Media Technology MSc programme I
      researched relationships between digital sound synthesis and physical
      interfaces through the development of 3 novel musical interfaces.

      In acoustic musical instruments, there is an inherent connection between
      sound production and control: the instrument is both the sound source and
      a means to control the qualities of the sound. In digital musical
      instruments, there is a clear separation between sound production: the
      sound synthesis, and control: the physical interface, such as a
      MIDI-keyboard or MIDI-controller. We have to explicitly design
      relationships between the sound synthesis and the controller. For my
      graduation research I ask the following question:
    </p>

    <p class="sentence_highlight">
      <i
        >What happens when we blur the separation between the physical interface
        and digital sound synthesis ?
      </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      For this research I have developed three physical interfaces in which the
      separation between sound production and control is blurred in various
      ways, while keeping the sound sound synthesis the same. Specifically, the
      interfaces vary in their ability of control and actual sound production,
      and in their similarity to the sound synthesis. For the sound synthesis I
      use a plucked string algorithm. For each interface, I performed different
      mapping experiments in which I test different relations between the output
      of the interface and the input of the synthesis model. The general
      approach for each interface is to regard it as both a sound source and a
      controller. This means that the sound, or data from the sensors is used
      both as input into the sound synthesis and as a means to control the
      synthesis parameters via signal analysis.

      Video demonstration of the "Bar-String" interface, showing some mapping
      experiments. The interface consists of a wooden bar that is played with
      mallets, captured by two contact microphones.
