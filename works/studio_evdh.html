      Between november 2015 and februari 2016 I did an internship at studio
      Edwin van der Heide. Edwin van der Heide is an artist, composer and
      researcher in the field of sound, space and interaction. During the
      internship I worked, together with fellow student Thijs Muijs and Edwin,
      on several both existing and new projects.

        >Schwingungen - Schwebungen</a
      >
      I assisted in the programming, composition and the realisation of the work
      on site at the University Library in Bonn. Schwingungen - Schwebungen
      consists of two large wooden horns and four circular metal horns that
      produce sound by means of compressed air in combination with pneumatic
      valves. The composition is formed around slowly changing sinusoidal tones
      that interfere with each other, creating spatial interferences between the
      sounds of the individual horns. The pictures below show the work in front
      of the University library.
